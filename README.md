#Flutter Technical Test

##Task 1: Build a Simple Flutter App
- Create a new Flutter project using the command line or your preferred IDE.
- Build a simple Flutter app with a single screen that shows a list of items.
- Each item in the list should display an image, title, and description.
- Use the following JSON API endpoint to fetch the data: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
- Parse the JSON data and use it to populate the list.
- Implement a search bar at the top of the screen that filters the list by title.

----

##Task 2: Implement an Animated Widget
- Add a button to the bottom of the screen that animates the list when pressed.
- The animation should rotate the entire list by 360 degrees and then back to its original position.
- The animation should take 2 seconds to complete and should be smooth and fluid.

----

##Task 3: Write Unit Tests
- Write unit tests to ensure that the search function works as expected.
- Write unit tests to ensure that the animation function works as expected.
- Write any additional tests you feel are necessary to ensure that the app functions correctly.
